webMethods API Gateway
==============================================

webMethods API Gateway is the core run time component in [webMethods API Management platform](https://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/api/default.html) and it enables organizations to secure, manage and monitor their API programs. It allows providers to securely expose APIs to external developers, partners, and other consumers.  API Gateway provides a dedicated, web-based user interface to perform all the administration and API related tasks such as creating APIs, defining and activating policies, creating applications, and consuming APIs. API Gateway gives you rich dashboard capabilities for API Analytics. 

APIs created in API Gateway can also be published to API Portal for external facing developers’ consumption.

Get API Gateway
----------------

webMethods API Gateway can be provisioned in multiple ways based on the users needs. Choose the one which works the best for you. 

*   **[WEBMETHODS.io](https://www.softwareag.cloud/site/product/webmethods-api.html)** \-  A _30 day free trial_ cloud account can be provisioned in less than 15 minutes. Visit SoftwareAG cloud and get your instance running in a region of your choice.
*   [**Docker**](https://hub.docker.com/_/softwareag-apigateway) \- A _90 day free trial_ version of API Gateway docker image can be pulled from the docker hub.                     

Get Started
-----------

Hope, everything went well in product provisioning . Lets now get started to explore the product capabilities. 

*   ****WEBMETHODS.io****  - You would have received a mail from Software AG with a link to login to your cloud account. Login and start the free trial of the products. In few mins, your cloud instance would be up and running. 
*   **Docker** - After the checkout, you would have landed in the "_How to use_" page which lists the detailed steps for spinning up a container with the docker image. Please follow the steps and get your instance started in few minutes.

### Assets creation

Hurrah!!!.. Now that the product is up and running and let's get into the real action of using it. First let us create an API and add some enforcement to it.

1.  Login to the webapp ([http://localhost:9072/)](http://localhost:9072/)) using the default credentials (Administrator/manage). If you are using API cloud, make sure to launch the "API Gateway" app. 
    
2.  Create a "DateAPI" by importing [the attached archive](attachments/651659260/651661834.zip) through the import option under the user menu. By default, this API is protected with the API Key security enforcement.
    
3.  Also, enable the global "_Transaction logging_" policies present under  _Policies → Global Policie_s. This would capture the metrics of all runtime invocations.

### API try out

Now, its all set for the runtime execution. If you have an API Portal instance available, you can publish this API to API Portal and try it out.

If not, no worries,we will just create an application in API Gateway itself. Under the _Applications_ section,create a new application, provide a name, consume the API(add our DateAPI under the APIs subsection) and click save. This will create an application and automatically provision an API Key. Copy the API access key from the application details page for invoking the API. Using any REST client, you can invoke the gateway endpoint(can be obtained from the API details page in Gateway) and pass the access key with the header _"x-Gateway-APIKey"._

### Explore Analytics

With the transaction Logging policy enabled, the information about runtime requests done in the above steps would have been captured and the same is rendered in the API Gateway analytics page. You can have a look at the global analytics and also API level analytics for more insights.
